The bundles are updated quite\nfrequently and sometimes they include 'comic' bundles.\n\nI recently picked up one of these comic bundles - 'Humble Comics Bundle: Star\nTrek presented by IDW ' which gave me a the opportunity to download (legally\npurchased) copies of some really cool old comic books. I wasn't much of a comic\nbook reader myself when I was younger, but I thought I might give these a go.\nI'm not overly interested in reading the comic books on my computer screen, for\nobvious reasons but instead I thought I might put these on my ereader instead. I\nam very lucky to have a Kobo Aura H2O\n[https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-aura-h2o-edition-2]  in my possession\nand this seemed like a great choice - however there was one problem; the PDFs\nprovided by Humble Bundle can exceed 2GB in size (yes that's right -- 2,000+MB\nper PDF). Obviously this would not do, because;\n\n * A Kobo simply cannot store  a PDF that large.\n * A Kobo additionally cannot render  a PDF of that size, even if it could be\n   stored.\n\nTo fix this problem, I did some research and discovered Ghostscript\n[https://www.ghostscript.com]  -- an AGPL software suite that processes files in\nand out of postscript. You can download Ghostscript from their website here\n[https://www.ghostscript.com/download/], but if you're on Mac or Linux you will\nalready have it -- it's called gs.
